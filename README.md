# Comcraft
ðŸš€ Craft your own terminal commands.

```
And then add this to the bottom of your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`:
```
export PATH=$HOME/.bin:$PATH
```

<hr>

###Creating a New Command
```
craft create mycommand
```
the `create` keyword is optional:
```
craft mycommand
```
Blast off! Comcraft should have created a `.lib` directory in your home directory. Find the new command and start editing. You're all set!

####Specify a Target Language/Environment
```
craft create mycommand --env=ruby
```
Available target languages are `node`, `ruby`, `python`, and `php`. 
If your language isn't here, just make quick tweak to your command file after you create it.

###Removing a Command
```
craft remove mycommand
```
That's it. Comcraft should have removed your command from the a `.lib` and `.bin` folders in your home directory.
