### Creating a New Command
```

the `create` keyword is optional:

Blast off! Comcraft should have created a `.lib` directory in your home directory. Find the new command and start editing. You're all set!

#### Specify a Target Language/Environment
```
craft create mycommand --env=ruby
```
Available target languages are `node`, `ruby`, `python`, `bash`, and `php`.  The default is `node`.
If your language isn't here, just make quick tweak to your command file after you create it.

### About Comcraft
Comcraft is a tool for you to make and organize your own terminal commands. It creates two folders in your home directory called `.bin` and `.lib`. All new commands are stored in the `.lib` folder and are pointed to by a symlink in the `.bin` directtory.
